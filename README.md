# mystudylifescript
A userscript that reduces the number of visible assignments, to make things less stressfull and reduce decision anxiety.

You can add more filters if you'd like, but this is a personal tool I use at https://app.mystudylife.com/tasks, and it was made for my own use. Thought I'd share it because it's a neat little script.
